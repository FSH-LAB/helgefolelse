# Helgefolelse

A small website that shows how close it feels to the weekend. The reading rises from Monday to Friday at 16:00, stays at 100 through Saturday, and falls on Sunday. All times are interpreted in `Europe/Oslo`.

## Getting started

Install Node.js 24 or newer and enable pnpm through Corepack. The repository pins the pnpm version in `package.json`.

```sh
corepack enable pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Run commands from the repository root unless noted otherwise.

## Commands

| Command                 | Purpose                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`              | Start the development server      |
| `pnpm build`            | Build the web app for production  |
| `pnpm lint`             | Run ESLint                        |
| `pnpm typecheck`        | Run TypeScript checks             |
| `pnpm format:check`     | Check formatting for CI           |
| `pnpm format`           | Format supported files            |
| `pnpm --filter web dev` | Run only the web app's dev script |

The root scripts use Turborepo to run tasks across workspaces. Currently there is one app, `web`; there are no shared packages or separate backend yet.

## Structure

- `apps/web/src/app/` - Next.js routes, layout, and the tide visualization.
- `apps/web/src/lib/` - the weekend calculation and display copy.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - workspace membership and dependency build settings.
- `turbo.json` - task orchestration and build caching.

This repository uses pnpm workspaces. Add app dependencies with `pnpm --filter web add <package>` and commit changes to `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Use pnpm rather than npm or Yarn so the lockfile stays consistent.
